    "# Mutable Data Type>>\n",
    " A mutable data type is those whose values can be changed.\n",
    " Example: List, Dictionaries, and Sets\n",
    "\n",
    " ### Python Lists\r\n",
    "Python lists methods are mutable; the list’s contents be modified in place. You can change a list in place, add new elements, overwrite existing elements, or delete them.\r\n",
    "### Python Dictionary\r\n",
    "Dictionaries are likely the most important and flexible mutable built-in data types in Python. In simple terms, a Python dictionary is a flexible-sized arbitrary collection of key-value pairs, where key and value both are Python objects.\r\n",
    "### Python Sets\r\n",
    "Sets are unordered collections of unique elements and immutable objects. You can think of them as a dictionary with just the keys and their values thrown away. Each item of a set should be unique. While sets themselves can be mutable, that is you can add or remove items, however, the items of a Python set must be of an immutable type.\r\n",
    " \r\n",
    "# Immutable Data Type>>\r\n",
    " An immutable data type is one in which the values can’t be changed or altered.\r\n",
    " Example: String and Tuples\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### Integers (int)\r\n",
    "It represents whole numbers, both positive&negative.Once an integer object is created,its value remains fixed.\r\n",
    "### Floating Points (float)\r\n",
    "It represents real numbers with decimal points,once a floating-point number is initialized, its value remains constant and cannot be altered.\r\n",
    "### Strings (str)\r\n",
    "Strings are ordered sequences of characters used to represent text.\r\n",
    "### Tuples (tuple)\r\n",
    "They are ordered collections of elements, similar to lists.\r\n",
    "The main distinction between tuples and lists is that tuples are immutable. \r\n",
    "This means that once a tuple is created, its content cannot be changed.\r\n",
    "### Booleans (bool)\r\n",
    "Booleans represent truth values and can only take True or False values.\r\n",
